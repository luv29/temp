1. Open empty folder in vs code.
2. in cmd, npm init / npm init -y (-y = by-default all yes)
3. make redme.md in vs code and write it for github.
4. Create github repa, and follow the commands written there to stup git repo.

To push empty folders in git: 
    we add a file name '.gitkeep' inside that empty folder.

To prevent some files from being pushed in git:
    Make a file '.gitignore' and write the names of those files inside it.
    There are gitignore generators online, that tell what files are most likely to be in there.

'.env' file:
    It contains the enivironment variables required for project

To prevent restarting server after every change:
    We install package 'nodemon', it automatically restartes after every change.
    It is not a main dependency, only used during development so we add it as dev dependency.
    npm install --save-dev nodemon / mpm i -D nodemon

Basic Project Structure:
    We write code inside a src folder.
    src folder generally has these folders: mkdir controllers db middlewares models routes utils

Prettier:
    mpm i -D Prettier
    make file '.prettierrc' to do formatting
    make file '.prettierignore' and mention files in which prettier will not be applied
