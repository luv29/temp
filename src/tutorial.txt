1. Open empty folder in vs code.
2. in cmd, npm init / npm init -y (-y = by-default all yes)
3. make redme.md in vs code and write it for github.
4. Create github repa, and follow the commands written there to stup git repo.

To push empty folders in git: 
    we add a file name '.gitkeep' inside that empty folder.

To prevent some files from being pushed in git:
    Make a file '.gitignore' and write the names of those files inside it.
    There are gitignore generators online, that tell what files are most likely to be in there.

'.env' file:
    It contains the enivironment variables required for project

To prevent restarting server after every change:
    We install package 'nodemon', it automatically restartes after every change.
    It is not a main dependency, only used during development so we add it as dev dependency.
    npm install --save-dev nodemon / mpm i -D nodemon

Setting up package.json:
    to use import , export we add "type": "module"
    in scripts we add, "dev": "nodemon stc/index.js"
    now whenever we run 'npm run dev' the above script is executed

Basic Project Structure:
    We write code inside a src folder.
    src folder generally has these folders: mkdir controllers db middlewares models routes utils

Prettier:
    mpm i -D Prettier
    make file '.prettierrc' to do formatting
    make file '.prettierignore' and mention files in which prettier will not be applied

npm i dotenv mongoose express:
    These 3 will be used in every backed project
    dotenv is not compatible with import as of now, so we have to use experimental features for that.
    So we have to do some minor change in the "dev".

Connecting Database:
    Make account on mongoDB atlas and get a database from there.
    We added PORT, MONGODB_URI in .env and DB_NAME in constants.js
